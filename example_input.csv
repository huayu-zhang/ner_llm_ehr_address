2,"Discharge Summary:

Patient: 60-year-old male with moderate ARDS from COVID-19

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. During physical therapy on the acute ward, the patient experienced coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation and dyspnea with any change of position or deep breathing. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, a step-by-step approach was used for position changes. The breathing exercises were adapted to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation, and with close monitoring, the patient managed to perform strength and walking exercises at a low level. Exercise progression was low initially but increased daily until hospital discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.

Clinical Outcome:

The patient was discharged on day 10 to a rehabilitation clinic making satisfactory progress with all symptoms resolved.

Follow-up:

The patient will receive follow-up care at the rehabilitation clinic, with regular monitoring of progress and further rehabilitation exercises until full recovery. Any new symptoms or concerns should be reported to the clinic immediately.

Overall Impression:

The patient responded well to treatment, and with appropriate medical intervention, was able to overcome the difficulties faced during hospitalization for ARDS from COVID-19. The patient's level of care was of a high standard, with all necessary therapy provided and monitoring of progress before discharge."
